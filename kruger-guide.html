                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>When is the best time of year to visit Kruger National Park?</h3>
                <p>The best time for game viewing is during the Dry Season (from May to September). The vegetation is less dense, making animals easier to spot. Also, water becomes scarce, so wildlife congregates around rivers and waterholes. The Wet Season (October to April) offers lush, beautiful scenery, is the best time for birdwatching, and you'll see many newborn animals, but game viewing can be more challenging.</p>

                <h3>Do I need to take malaria precautions for Kruger?</h3>
                <p>Yes, Kruger National Park is located in a malaria-risk area. It is highly recommended that you consult with your doctor or a travel clinic well in advance of your trip. They can provide the most up-to-date advice and prescribe appropriate antimalarial medication if necessary.</p>

                <h3>Is it safe to do a self-drive safari in Kruger?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. A self-drive safari is a fantastic and very safe way to experience the park, provided you strictly follow the rules. The most important rules are to stay inside your vehicle at all times (unless you are in a designated rest camp or picnic spot), do not feed the animals, and adhere to the speed limits. The animals are wild but are accustomed to vehicles, so they will typically ignore you if you keep a respectful distance.</p>

                <h3>What are the "Big Five"?</h3>
                <p>The "Big Five" is a term originally used by hunters for the five most difficult and dangerous African animals to hunt on foot. Today, it's a safari checklist. The animals are the <strong>Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Rhino,</strong> and <strong>Cape Buffalo</strong>. While they can be found throughout the park, areas like the Sabie River are famous for leopard sightings, and the grasslands around Satara are excellent for lions.</p>
